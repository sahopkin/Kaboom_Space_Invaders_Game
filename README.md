# Kaboom Space Invaders Game
This repository contains the sprites and scripts to build a variation of Space Invaders using Kaboom.Js v3000

The game is built using Google Apps Script and deployed as a WebApp. In order to do so, 4 files are created:

- Code.gs
- index.html
- css.html
- js.html
  
The Kaboom code is all written within the js.html file. Sprites for the game are located in the Game_Sprites folder.
